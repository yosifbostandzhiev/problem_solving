# 1.    Write a program that inputs a positive integer N and outputs the factorial of 2N
# 2.    Write a program that counts and outputs the number of digits in Nth Fibonacci number
# •    Example:
# Please input a positive integer: 13
# Number of digits in F5 is: 3
# 3.    Write a program that inputs three real numbers and outputs whether they can be sides of a triangle
# 4.    Write a program that calculates and outputs the first N even Fibonacci numbers, separated
# by comma and space. N is entered from the standard input.
# 5.    Write a program that calculates and outputs the sum of the digits of N factorial (N!).
# 6. Write a program that checks and prints whether two rectangles overlap.The rectangles’
# sides are parallel to x and y axes.Each rectangle is determined by the coordinates of its
# upper - left and lower - right corner.Those coordinates need to be input(you may use integer numbers).
#  Exampleoutput: Rectangles overlap
# 7.Write a program that outputs the following triangle(height=11):.
# Image of rectangle: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876821589923102740/883949940374638652/unknown.png
# 8.The same triangle as previous, but having height and symbol input by the user.
# 9.Write a program that outputs the first N natural numbers in a rectangle with a given width (W).
# The width is the number of symbols ( not numbers) in a line! Numbers are printed in
# ascending order sequentially in horizontal direction until line is complete and the
# sequence continues on the next line, etc.No spaces.The text on the console shall look as a
# rectangular block (the last line may be incomplete).N and W are entered by the user.
# 10.Write a program that inputs an integer and checks whether it is a prime number.
